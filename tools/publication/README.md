## Introduction

All information on the software needed for publishing it is stored in the merged metadata file.

However, for most platforms, you need to provide some sort of Authorization (such as an Access Token or login credentials) to have it automatically uploaded by the pipeline.
All relevant info may be added in the `config.sh` file of this folder.
Afterwards, feel free to initiate **any** of the surrounding publication processes by running the appropriate shell script (`*.sh`) from the command line.
